simulate_robot_v001.m       - simulates robot with sinusoidal wheel angular velocities, does not draw field
simulate_robot_v002.m       - simulates robot with sinusoidal wheel angular velocities, draws field with field elements
simulate_robot_v003.m       - simulates robot with calculated wheel angular velocities all_omega_R, all_omega_L, draws field with field elements

To run the non-holonomic motion planning algorithm, do (however, algorithm has bugs, doesn't work correctly)
test_001
simulate_v003


test_003                    -  sets up parameters for arc & straight lines motion planning
